# Location-visual

Visulaising various locations using the googlemaps API. The visualisation part is done using d3.js. Here we are visualising vaious universities' location on the map. You can add your own university in the where.data part and it will show the location on the map represented with a red dot. This was a part of my Coursera Python specialisation. The visualisation part was provided. I contributed with reading the data and storing it in sqllite database and then extarcting said data.
